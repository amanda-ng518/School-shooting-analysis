# Abstract

# 1. Introduction

Gun violence in schools remains one of the most distressing manifestations of firearm-related harm in the United States (citation). Each incident not only causes immediate loss and trauma but also heightens public concern over the safety of educational environments. Yet, relatively little is known about why some school shootings result in fatalities while others do not. 
A clearer grasp of these determinants is essential for developing data-driven prevention strategies and guiding school safety policies. Previous research has examined individual-level factors such as shooter motivation, access to firearms, and mental health (citation). Fewer studies, however, have focused on contextual-level characteristics—that is, features of the incident and school environment that may influence whether a shooting becomes fatal. This study addresses that gap by identifying contextual factors that heighten the risk of fatalities, offering valuable insights for anticipating and mitigating the most severe outcomes of school shootings.

The estimand of interest is the probability that a school shooting results in at least one fatality. Using logistic regression, we modeled this probability as a function of several contextual characteristics, including whether the incident involved any injuries, the shooting type, the shooter’s demographics and relationship to the school community, and the broader racial and socioeconomic composition of the school.

Results show that shootings involving at least one injury, those classified as targeted attacks, and those committed by shooters with no apparent or unknown relationship to the school were significantly more likely to result in fatalities. These findings suggest that shootings perpetrated by individuals with no direct relationship to the school are less predictable and may be characterized by greater intent or premeditation. Sich such incidents fall outside the scope of internal monitoring systems focused on students and staff, they highlight the importance of strengthening external security coordination—including access control for school facilities, improved information sharing with law enforcement and between schools, and preparedness for rapid emergency response. Understanding these patterns provides a foundation for more effective risk assessment, prevention strategies, and resource allocation to protect students and school communities.

Section 2: Data describes the data source, alongside the cleaning and 
preparation of the data set for analysis. A summary of key variables and exploratory data 
visualizations is also presented. Section 3: Modelling explains the modeling approach, 
logistic regression model, used to analyze the relationship between the likelihood of fatality and 
shooting events' contextual characteristics, along with justifications of 
appropriateness of the model design. Section 4: Results & Discussion presents 
the results and interprets the significance of the predictors considered on dropout risk. 
Limitations of the study, including data quality and practical usability of
the models, are also discussed. Finally, Section 5: Conclusion summarizes the key insights and outlines the
next steps for future studies. Supporting information, including model assumptions and checks, is provided
in the Section 6: Appendix.

# 5. Conclusion
These incidents may be less predictable because they occur outside existing social or disciplinary networks — schools can’t rely on familiar early-warning signs like student behavioral issues, conflict reports, or peer concerns.
Such shooters may enter the school with higher intent or preparation, possibly bringing more lethal weapons or planning attacks more deliberately.Because they are external actors, existing school-based prevention systems (focused on students and staff) may be less effective in identifying or deterring them beforehand.
schools canit easily prevent these attacks directly — but it highlights a different area of vulnerability and thus a different kind of prevention need:It suggests that school safety cannot rely solely on internal behavioral monitoring (e.g., identifying at-risk students).
There is a need for stronger external security coordination — for instance, improving access control, visitor screening, and information sharing between schools, law enforcement, and community organizations.
It also underscores the importance of rapid emergency response and preparedness training, since these events tend to be sudden and high-lethality when they occur.
